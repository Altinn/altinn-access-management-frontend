# Access management frontend

# Setup environment üöÄ
## Step 1: Getting started 

- To run or build the frontend, you'll need to download [Node minimum v21 ](https://nodejs.org/).
- Enable corepack on your machine and download yarn via corepack (don't download yarn globally, it will give you problems at some later point). Follow this [guide](https://yarnpkg.com/getting-started/install) to download yarn. 
- After that is done simply run `yarn` on root to install dependencies and then `yarn start` to start the development environment.

PS: To actually see anything on the local environment port you'll need to follow the guide until step 3.

## Step 2: Setup localtest to get test users

To add test data to the app, do the following:

- Clone following [repo](https://github.com/Altinn/app-localtest) and checkout branch feature/accessmanagement-subdomain(and for windows it's important to checkout commit 9ba9110e7934c4628076450d92bf829df8413619). Also remember to follow readme in that branch (Because localtest for podman doesn't work yet). You have completed this step when you can run localtest.
- Sometimes the docker command isn't recognized on computer, if so try to run this command:
```bash
   export PATH="$PATH:/Applications/Docker.app/Contents/Resources/bin/"
```

### If readme in localTest doesn't setup things correctly, try the steps below:

  - Start the loadbalancer container that routes between the local platform services and the app with command below:

     ```bash
     docker-compose up -d --build
     ```

  - If having problems with docker command try running this: export PATH="$PATH:/Applications/Docker.app/Contents/Resources/bin/"
   
  - Navigate to the `src` folder in the app-localtest repo

     ```bash
     cd src/
     ```

  - Run below command in that folder

     ```bash
     docker-compose up -d --build
     ```

  - Set path to app folder in local platform services. The simplest way to do this is:

     - Edit the appsettings.json file:
        - Open `appSettings.json` in an editor.
        - Change the setting `"AppRepsitoryBasePath"` to the path to the folder where you've cloned your frontend and backend repos. (Be aware that on mac you don't have c:/ in your paths.)
        - Create folder AltinnPlatformLocal wherever you like, copy and paste path to that folder in LocalTestingStorageBasePath.
        - Set LocalTestingStaticTestDataPath to your full path to the file in src/testdata     
          

  - Start the local platform services (make sure you are in the src folder)
  
     ```bash
     dotnet run
     ```

- Add below text to your hosts file (Path to file on mac: /private/etc/hosts. Path to file on Windows: c:\Windows\System32\Drivers\etc\hosts.
On mac you need to edit and save hosts-file, we recommend to use vs code for mac to edit the file)

```#Subdomain for accessmanagement
#Subdomain for accessmanagement
127.0.0.1 am.ui.local.altinn.cloud #ipv4
0000:0000:0000:0000:0000:0000:0000:0001 am.ui.local.altinn.cloud #ipv6
#
# Host Database
#
# localhost is used to configure the loopback interface
# when the system is booting.  Do not change this entry.
##
127.0.0.1    localhost #ipv4
0000:0000:0000:0000:0000:0000:0000:0001 localhost #ipv6
255.255.255.255    broadcasthost
127.0.0.1 kubernetes.docker.internal #ipv4
0000:0000:0000:0000:0000:0000:0000:0001 kubernetes.docker.internal #ipv6
# Added by Docker Desktop
# To allow the same kube context to work on the host and the container:
127.0.0.1 kubernetes.docker.internal
# End of section
   ```

## Step 3: Setup BFF (Backend for frontend)

- Open Altinn.AccessManagement.UI.sln in an IDE
- Build solution
- Run solution
- Go to http://local.altinn.cloud/
- Select user and continue
- To see single rights feature, go to url: http://am.ui.local.altinn.cloud/accessmanagement/ui/delegate-single-rights/choose-service
- Paths to other parts of the application can be found on: src/routes/paths

# Setup backend:

## Step 4: Set up database: 
  Download [PostgreSQL v14](https://www.postgresql.org/download/). (on Mac, use installer and not homebrew). Run stackbuilder and download all packages when being prompted.
<img width="1254" alt="image" src="https://github.com/Altinn/altinn-access-management-frontend/assets/31471142/bd1f6ec6-91bb-411b-8746-df5fe8272fbf">

- Open pgAdmin 4
- Create the following users by right clicking PostgreSQL 14 and clicking create user group or by scrolling down and right clickking Login/Group Roles (with privileges for authorizationdb):
  1. Name: platform_authorization_admin (superuser, canlogin). Set password as Password.
  2. Name: platform_authorization (canlogin). Set password as Password.
- Create database with name: authorizationdb by right clicking on databases and choosing "Create database" and set owner to platform_authorization_admin in properties.
- Create schema delegation in authorizationdb
- Set platform_authorization_admin as owner

### Run backend and frontend
- Open Altinn-Access-Management repo in an IDE and go to following folder https://github.com/Altinn/altinn-access-management

  ```bash
   cd src/Altinn.AccessManagement.UI
   ```
- ON MAC: change WorkspacePath in file: src/Altinn.AccessManagement/appsettings.Development.json to "Altinn.AccessManagement.Persistence/Migration".

- Start Access Management Backend

   ```bash
   dotnet run
   ```
- Start the BFF (AccessManagement.UI)
  ```bash
   dotnet run
   ```

- Start Access Management Frontend (if not started)

  - Go to access-management-frontend repo
  - Run 'yarn'
  - run 'yarn start'

- Go to http://local.altinn.cloud/

- You should now see localtest login page with access management as the only application

- Choose an account and click on button to proceed to react-app

# Build, Deploy and Release

## Building and deploying üöö

To create a distributable bundle, run `yarn build`. Environment variables set at build time will be baked into the bundle (e.g. `VITE_DEFAULT_LOCALE=en yarn build`). See the resulting `dist/index.html`. If the bundled files are to be served from a path other than the server root, you must pass the `--base=/path/to/folder/` argument to `yarn build`.

## Pull Request Labels
[pr-labeler](https://github.com/Altinn/altinn-access-management-frontend/blob/main/.github/workflows/pr-labeler.yml) action is triggered for each pull request. 
Based on the branch name, this action adds a label to the pull request. The configuration for the labels can be found [here](https://github.com/Altinn/altinn-access-management-frontend/blob/main/.github/pr-labeler.yml).

## Build

### Frontend
[build-frontend](https://github.com/Altinn/altinn-access-management-frontend/blob/main/.github/workflows/build-frontend.yaml) action is triggered for each pull request with frontend change. This action runs the linting and unit tests for the frontend components.

### Backend
[build-and-analyze-backend](https://github.com/Altinn/altinn-access-management-frontend/blob/main/.github/workflows/build-and-analyze-backend.yml) action is triggered for pull requests with backend change. This action builds, runs the unit tests for backend and analyzes the backend code.

## Deploy
Code is continously integrated and deployed to AT environments. Pipeline: build-publish-deploy-via-ghcr is triggered when a pull request is merged into  main branch.
On each run, the code is built, packaged and published to Github Container registry as [altinn-access-management-frontend](https://github.com/Altinn/altinn-access-management-frontend/pkgs/container/altinn-access-management-frontend). Each image is tagged with the github commit sha. The package is then deployed to an azure container app in testing environment.
The environment variables and secrets for the action are setup in the repository settings.

## Release
The application has a release every wednesday. [scheduled-release](https://github.com/Altinn/altinn-access-management-frontend/blob/main/.github/workflows/scheduled-release.yml) action is triggered every wednesday 00.00. This action drafts a release, tags the latest package with the release version, f.ex this package has a release version [v2023.1](https://github.com/Altinn/altinn-access-management-frontend/pkgs/container/altinn-access-management-frontend/88857835?tag=14685620a8aaf7b867b5a346155ca09ef9c34f3d).
The action drafts the release on different categories. The changes are categorized based on the pull request label. F.ex, A PR with a label bugfix is categorized under bug. The detailed release draft configuration can be found [here](https://github.com/Altinn/altinn-access-management-frontend/blob/main/.github/release-drafter.yml)
The deploy in charge for the week, deploys the application to a specific environment(TT02/Prod) using the action [deploy-to-environment](https://github.com/Altinn/altinn-access-management-frontend/blob/main/.github/workflows/deploy-to-environment.yml). The drafted release is then reviewed manually and published by the deploy in charge.

# Project organisation and code conventions üß©

## yarn commands üß®

Run `yarn` to setup code.

Run `yarn build` to create a build file.

Run `yarn test` to run cypress tests in browser.

Run `yarn coverage` to see test coverage stats.

Run `yarn lint` to run lint checks

Run `yarn format` to format most of the codebase to set standard in config file

The main entry point is `/src/main.jsx`. You'll find React components under `/src/components/`.

The components can be placed 2 ways, either:


## Repo structure

```
If the component's only reusable within a specific feature
features\
  featureName\
    components\
    - ComponentName.test.tsx (unit tests)
    - index.ts (public interface for the component)
    - style.css (if needed)

Or:

If the components are reusable and being used by other classes
components/
  ComponentName/
    - ComponentName.tsx
    - ComponentName.test.tsx (unit tests)
    - style.css (if needed)

```

## Coding conventions üëÆ‚Äç‚ôÄÔ∏è

### Naming convention on branches
Start with these names for your branch depending on what your branch includes.

  - bugfix/
  - chore/
  - dependencies/
  - documentation/
  - feat/single-rights/issue-number
  - feat/api-delegations/issue-number
  - feat/general/issue-number       (When it's not related to any features of the features above or relates to both)

### ClassNames

Use [PascalCase](https://techterms.com/definition/pascalcase) for component file names.

### Code style

We use [eslint](https://eslint.org/), [prettier](https://prettier.io/), typescript, and automatically set up git hooks to enforce
these on commits. To avoid confusion, it is recommended to set this up in your IDE.

### Visual Studio Code

Install the [eslint extension from the marketplace](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=dbaeumer.vscode-eslint). Configure your IDE to run `eslint --fix` on save (prettier will also reformat your code when doing this).

### WebStorm and IntelliJ IDEA

Configure your IDE to run `eslint --fix` on save (prettier will also reformat your code when doing this). It is also recommended to
[set up Prettier as the default formatter](https://www.jetbrains.com/help/webstorm/prettier.html#ws_prettier_default_formatter).

### CSS

We use standard camelCase for classnames to enable linking of the stylesheets directly and improving simplicity in the process. We separate each Element and Modifier into separate names and use regular css (eks: `.accordion.open`) to access the combination.

## Common problems in VS code
1. Sometimes it's needed to restart eslint for it to work properly. E.g. When switching branches, eslint hangs sometimes. To fix this problem in vs code: Do the hot key for workbench.action.quickNaviagtePreviousInFilePicker and run command 'restart eslint server' or restart vs code.
2. It's a common problem when writing reducers in rtk; invalid typescript-errors, prettier and lint-errors occurs. To fix this you could try to restart vs code or ignore the error.
