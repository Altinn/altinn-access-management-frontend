# Frontend for access management

## Getting started üöÄ

To run or build the frontend, you'll need [Node](https://nodejs.org/) and [Yarn](https://yarnpkg.com/getting-started/install). Simply run `yarn` on root to install dependencies and then `yarn start` to start the development environment. The current prefix is http://localhost:5173 (but this port might changed later). FYI: http://localhost:5173 doesn't show anything right now and it shouldn't show anything either. Go to http://localhost:5173/accessmanagement/ui/api-delegations to see one of the main views of API delegations. Look in the folder src/routes/Router to see different paths to the different components.

## Project organisation üß©

The main entry point is `/src/main.tsx`. You'll find React components under `/src/components/`.

The basic file structure for components should be:

```
If the subcomponent's not reusable
components\
  ComponentName\
    - ComponentName.tsx
    - ComponentName.test.tsx (unit tests)
    - index.ts (public interface for the component)
    - style.css (if needed)
      SubComponent1\
        - SubComponent1.tsx (if the subcomponent is not reusable)
        - index.ts (public interface for the component)
        - style.css (if needed)
        SubComponent2\
          - SubComponent2.tsx (if the subcomponent is not reusable)
          - index.ts (public interface for the component)
          - style.css (if needed)


If the subcomponents are reusable and being used by other classes
components/
  ComponentName/
    - ComponentName.tsx
    - ComponentName.test.tsx (unit tests)
    - index.ts (public interface for the component)
    - style.css (if needed)
  Reusables/
    SubComponent1/
      - SubComponent1.tsx (if the subcomponent is not reusable)
      - SubComponent1.test.tsx (unit tests)
      - index.ts (public interface for the component)
      - style.css (if needed)
    SubComponent2/
      - SubComponent2.tsx (if the subcomponent is not reusable)
      - SubComponent2.test.tsx (unit tests)
      - index.ts (public interface for the component)
      - style.css (if needed)

```

## Coding conventions üëÆ‚Äç‚ôÄÔ∏è

### ClassNames

Use [PascalCase](https://techterms.com/definition/pascalcase) for both component and file names.

### Code style

We use [eslint](https://eslint.org/), [prettier](https://prettier.io/), typescript, and automatically set up git hooks to enforce
these on commits. To avoid confusion, it is recommended to set this up your IDE.

### Visual Studio Code

Install the [eslint extension from the marketplace](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=dbaeumer.vscode-eslint). Configure your IDE to run `eslint --fix` on save (prettier will also reformat your code when doing this).

### WebStorm and IntelliJ IDEA

Configure your IDE to run `eslint --fix` on save (prettier will also reformat your code when doing this). It is also recommended to
[set up Prettier as the default formatter](https://www.jetbrains.com/help/webstorm/prettier.html#ws_prettier_default_formatter).

### CSS

We name css classes using camelCase and use one concept from [BEM naming convention](http://getbem.com/naming/). The concept we use is that we give classes '__' extension when there's variants of the class. E.g. alert__danger alert__warning. basically everywhere you'd use the extension '--', we use __ instead. The reason for this is that we can link stylesheets directly, which improves readability.


## Tests üß®

Run `yarn test` to run cypress tests in browser.

Run `yarn coverage` to see pretty test coverage stats.

Run 'yarn lint' to run lint checks

## Building and deploying üöö

To create a distributable bundle, run `yarn build`. Environment variables set at build time will be baked into the bundle (e.g. `VITE_DEFAULT_LOCALE=en yarn build`). See the resulting `dist/index.html` for an example on how to load the build. At the moment you have to search for "/locales/${t.language}.json" and change it to "./locales/${t.language}.json".

If the bundled files are to be served from a path other than the server root, you must pass the `--base=/path/to/folder/` argument to `yarn build`. The trailing slash is important.

## Common problems in vs code
1. Sometimes it's needed to restart eslint for it to work properly. E.g. When switching branches, eslint hangs sometimes. To fix this problem in vs code: Do the hot key for workbench.action.quickNaviagtePreviousInFilePicker and run command 'restart eslint server' or restart vs code.
2. It's a common problem when writing reducers in rtk; invalid typescript-errors, prettier and lint-errors occur saying e.g. ',' is missing when in reality it's not. My suggestion is to restart vs code or ignore the error(if it's still possible to run the code). 


## Run code with access-management backend

To run the code together with access-management backend to the following


- Checkout Altinn-Studio repo and 

- Navigate to the `development` folder in the altinn-studio repo

   ```bash
   cd src/development
   ```

- Start the loadbalancer container that routes between the local platform services and the app

   ```bash
   docker-compose up -d --build
   ```
   
   
- Navigate to the `development/LocalTest` folder in the altinn-studio repo

   ```bash
   cd src/development/LocalTest

- Run below command in that folder

   ```bash
   docker-compose up
   ```

- Set path to app folder in local platform services. There are two ways to do this:

   - Edit the appsettings.json file:
      - Open `appSettings.json` in the `src/development/LocalTest` in an editor.
      - Change the setting `"AppRepsitoryBasePath"` to the path to the folder where you've cloned the altinn-studio repo.
      - Be aware that on mac you don't have c:/ in your paths.
      - Create folder AltinnPlatformLocal wherever you like, copy and paste path to that folder in LocalTestingStorageBasePath.
      - Set LocalTestingStaticTestDataPath to your full path to the file in devlopment/TestData     
          

- Start the local platform services (make sure you are in the LocalTest folder)

   ```bash
   dotnet run
   ```

- Set up database: Download [PostgreSQL](https://www.postgresql.org/download/) (Currently using 14 in Azure, but 15 works locally) 
- Install database server (choose your own admin password and save it some place you can find it again)
- Start PG admin
- Create database and call it authorizationdb
- Create the following users (with priveliges for authorizationdb) 
- platform_authorization_admin (superuser, canlogin)
- platform_authorization (canlogin)
- password: Password
- Create schema delegations in authorizationdb
- Set platform_authorization_admin as owner

- Open Altinn-Access-Management repo in an IDE and go to following folder.

  ```bash
   cd src/Altinn.AccessManagement
   ```
- ON MAC: change WorkspacePath in file: src/Altinn.AccessManagement/appsettings.Development.json to "Altinn.AccessManagement.Persistence/Migration".

- Start Access Management

   ```bash
   dotnet run
   ```

- Start Access Management Frontend (if not started)

- Go to access-management-frontend repo

- run 'yarn start'

- Go to http://local.altinn.cloud/

- You should now see localtest intro with access management as only application

- Choose an account and click on button to proceed to react-app
