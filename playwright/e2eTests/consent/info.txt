Test must do the following

1. Use api to generate some testdata that should appear on the consent approval thingy 
2. Verify all the different template's nuances and differences
3. approve / reject
4. Vary test users used (fetch hard coded values from Tenor, then use those randomly to avoid reusing the same user over and over)
5. When you're done - refactor and move everything out to a page object model for Consent
